  # Abstract base class of all decorations. Forwards the methods

  # For example, a HeaderFooterDecoration class could draw a header and footer
  # around the decorations or components below itself:
  #
  #   class HeaderFooterDecoration < Wee::Decoration

    # all decorations or components "below" it (everything that follows this
    # decoration in the chain). In other words, it's the owner of everything
    # "below" itself.

    # decoration is added in front of all other local decorations but after all
